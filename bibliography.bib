  isbn = {978-0-7923-8278-2},
  abstract = {Problems with multiple objectives and criteria are generally known as multiple criteria optimization or multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. So far, these types of problems have typically been modelled and solved by means of linear programming. However, many real-life phenomena are of a nonlinear nature, which is why we need tools for nonlinear programming capable of handling several conflicting or incommensurable objectives. In this case, methods of traditional single objective optimization and linear programming are not enough; we need new ways of thinking, new concepts, and new methods - nonlinear multiobjective optimization.  Nonlinear Multiobjective Optimization provides an extensive, up-to-date, self-contained and consistent survey, review of the literature and of the state of the art on nonlinear (deterministic) multiobjective optimization, its methods, its theory and its background. The amount of literature on multiobjective optimization is immense. The treatment in this book is based on approximately 1500 publications in English printed mainly after the year 1980.  Problems related to real-life applications often contain irregularities and nonsmoothnesses. The treatment of nondifferentiable multiobjective optimization in the literature is rather rare. For this reason, this book contains material about the possibilities, background, theory and methods of nondifferentiable multiobjective optimization as well.  This book is intended for both researchers and students in the areas of (applied) mathematics, engineering, economics, operations research and management science; it is meant for both professionals and practitioners in many different fields of application. The intention has been to provide a consistent summary that may help in selecting an appropriate method for the problem to be solved. It is hoped the extensive bibliography will be of value to researchers.},

In this paper, we review two prominent approaches that have recently been proposed for this problem, and identify their common need for an appropriate initial condition to start the recursive algorithms. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm that combines a linear-matrix-inequality method with a gradient method for automatic generation of initial conditions. By incorporating the initial conditions, optimal grasping forces can be generated efficiently in real time. Finally, we implement and evaluate all the algorithms for grasping-force control in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology three-fingered hand platform. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

@book{luenberger_linear_2015,
  title = {Linear and {{Nonlinear Programming}}},
  isbn = {978-3-319-18842-3},
  abstract = {This new edition covers the central concepts of practical optimization techniques, with an emphasis on methods that are both state-of-the-art and popular. One major insight is the connection between the purely analytical character of an optimization problem and the behavior of algorithms used to solve a problem. This was a major theme of the first edition of this book and the fourth edition expands and further illustrates this relationship. As in the earlier editions, the material in this fourth edition is organized into three separate parts. Part I is a self-contained introduction to linear programming. The presentation in this part is fairly conventional, covering the main elements of the underlying theory of linear programming, many of the most effective numerical algorithms, and many of its important special applications. Part II, which is independent of Part I, covers the theory of unconstrained optimization, including both derivations of the appropriate optimality conditions and an introduction to basic algorithms. This part of the book explores the general properties of algorithms and defines various notions of convergence. Part III extends the concepts developed in the second part to constrained optimization problems. Except for a few isolated sections, this part is also independent of Part I. It is possible to go directly into Parts II and III omitting Part I, and, in fact, the book has been used in this way in many universities.New to this edition is a chapter devoted to Conic Linear Programming, a powerful generalization of Linear Programming. Indeed, many conic structures are possible and useful in a variety of applications. It must be recognized, however, that conic linear programming is an advanced topic, requiring special study. Another important topic is an accelerated steepest descent method that exhibits superior convergence properties, and for this reason, has become quite popular. The proof of the convergence property for both standard and accelerated steepest descent methods are presented in Chapter 8. As in previous editions, end-of-chapter exercises appear for all chapters.From the reviews of the Third Edition:“... this very well-written book is a classic textbook in Optimization. It should be present in the bookcase of each student, researcher, and specialist from the host of disciplines from which practical optimization applications are drawn.” (Jean-Jacques Strodiot, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1207, 2011)},

	abstract = {This paper presents two-swim operators to be added to the chemotaxis process of the modified bacterial foraging optimization algorithm to solve three instances of the synthesis of four-bar planar mechanisms. One swim favors exploration while the second one promotes fine movements in the neighborhood of each bacterium. The combined effect of the new operators looks to increase the production of better solutions during the search. As a consequence, the ability of the algorithm to escape from local optimum solutions is enhanced. The algorithm is tested through four experiments and its results are compared against two BFOA-based algorithms and also against a differential evolution algorithm designed for mechanical design problems. The overall results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other BFOA-based approaches and finds highly competitive mechanisms, with a single set of parameter values and with less evaluations in the first synthesis problem, with respect to those mechanisms obtained by the differential evolution algorithm, which needed a parameter fine-tuning process for each optimization problem.},

	abstract = {Master modeling and simulation using Modelica, the new powerful, highly versatile object-based modeling language Modelica, the new object-based software/hardware modeling language that is quickly gaining popularity around the world, offers an almost universal approach to high-level computational modeling and simulation. It handles a broad range of application domains, for example mechanics, electrical systems, control, and thermodynamics, and facilitates general notation as well as powerful abstractions and efficient implementations. Using the versatile Modelica language and its associated technology, this text presents an object-oriented, component-based approach that makes it possible for readers to quickly master the basics of computer-supported equation-based object-oriented (EOO) mathematical modeling and simulation. Throughout the text, Modelica is used to illustrate the various aspects of modeling and simulation. At the same time, a number of key concepts underlying the Modelica language are explained with the use of modeling and simulation examples. This book:   Examines basic concepts such as systems, models, and simulations   Guides readers through the Modelica language with the aid of several step-by-step examples   Introduces the Modelica class concept and its use in graphical and textual modeling   Explores modeling methodology for continuous, discrete, and hybrid systems   Presents an overview of the Modelica Standard Library and key Modelica model libraries   Readers will find plenty of examples of models that simulate distinct application domains as well as examples that combine several domains. All the examples and exercises in the text are available via DrModelica. This electronic self-teaching program, freely available on the text's companion website, guides readers from simple, introductory examples and exercises to more advanced ones. Written by the Director of the Open Source Modelica Consortium, Introduction to Modeling and Simulation of Technical and Physical Systems with Modelica is recommended for engineers and students interested in computer-aided design, modeling, simulation, and analysis of technical and natural systems. By building on basic concepts, the text is ideal for students who want to learn modeling, simulation, and object orientation.},

	abstract = {A new hybridization of the Cuckoo Search (CS) is developed and applied to optimize multi-cell solar systems; namely multi-junction and split spectrum cells. The new approach consists of combining the CS with the Nelder-Mead method. More precisely, instead of using single solutions as nests for the CS, we use the concept of a simplex which is used in the Nelder-Mead algorithm. This makes it possible to use the flip operation introduces in the Nelder-Mead algorithm instead of the Levy flight which is a standard part of the CS. In this way, the hybridized algorithm becomes more robust and less sensitive to parameter tuning which exists in CS. The goal of our work was to optimize the performance of multi-cell solar systems. Although the underlying problem consists of the minimization of a function of a relatively small number of parameters, the difficulty comes from the fact that the evaluation of the function is complex and only a small number of evaluations is possible. In our test, we show that the new method has a better performance when compared to similar but more compex hybridizations of Nelder-Mead algorithm using genetic algorithms or particle swarm optimization on standard benchmark functions. Finally, we show that the new method outperforms some standard meta-heuristics for the problem of interest.},

The motivation for the hybridization is a notion of combining the best of two worlds: evolutionary black box optimization and local search. Successful hybridizations in large combinatorial solution spaces motivate to transfer the idea of combining the two worlds to continuous domains as well. The question arises: Can local search also improve the convergence to the Pareto front in continuous multiobjective solutions spaces? We introduce a relay and a concurrent hybridization of the successful multiobjective optimizer SMS-EMOA and local optimization methods like Hooke \& Jeeves and the Newton method. The concurrent approach is based on a parameterized probability function to control the local search. Experimental analyses on academic test functions show increased convergence speed as well as improved accuracy of the solution set of the new hybridizations.},

The author shows how to solve non-convex multi-objective optimization problems using simple modifications of the basic PSO code. The book also introduces multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) architectures—one of the first optimization books to do so—and develops software codes for the simplex method and affine-scaling interior point method for solving linear programming problems. In addition, it examines Gomory’s cutting plane method, the branch-and-bound method, and Balas’ algorithm for integer programming problems.  The author follows a step-by-step approach to developing the MATLAB® codes from the algorithms. He then applies the codes to solve both standard functions taken from the literature and real-world applications, including a complex trajectory design problem of a robot, a portfolio optimization problem, and a multi-objective shape optimization problem of a reentry body. This hands-on approach improves your understanding and confidence in handling different solution methods. The MATLAB codes are available on the book’s CRC Press web page.},

A comprehensive set of problems and exercises makes the book suitable for use in one or two semesters of a first-year graduate course or an advanced undergraduate course.

The practical orientation of the topics chosen and a wealth of useful examples also make the book suitable as a reference work for practitioners in the field.

	title = {Linear {Programming} and {Extensions}},
	isbn = {9781400884179},
	abstract = {In real-world problems related to finance, business, and management, mathematicians and economists frequently encounter optimization problems. In this classic book, George Dantzig looks at a wealth of examples and develops linear programming methods for their solutions. He begins by introducing the basic theory of linear inequalities and describes the powerful simplex method used to solve them. Treatments of the price concept, the transportation problem, and matrix methods are also given, and key mathematical concepts such as the properties of convex sets and linear vector spaces are covered. George Dantzig is properly acclaimed as the "father of linear programming." Linear programming is a mathematical technique used to optimize a situation. It can be used to minimize traffic congestion or to maximize the scheduling of airline flights. He formulated its basic theoretical model and discovered its underlying computational algorithm, the "simplex method," in a pathbreaking memorandum published by the United States Air Force in early 1948. Linear Programming and Extensions provides an extraordinary account of the subsequent development of his subject, including research in mathematical theory, computation, economic analysis, and applications to industrial problems.  Dantzig first achieved success as a statistics graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. One day he arrived for a class after it had begun, and assumed the two problems on the board were assigned for homework. When he handed in the solutions, he apologized to his professor, Jerzy Neyman, for their being late but explained that he had found the problems harder than usual. About six weeks later, Neyman excitedly told Dantzig, "I've just written an introduction to one of your papers. Read it so I can send it out right away for publication." Dantzig had no idea what he was talking about. He later learned that the "homework" problems had in fact been two famous unsolved problems in statistics.},

	abstract = {Recent studies show that evolutionary algorithms are effective optimization tools for their success in solving real-world problem with complex and competing specifications. Although their performances are greatly influenced by the type of representation adopted, this choice often arises from intuition and guesswork due to the absence of proper guidelines and framework. This paper considers binary representation and presents a comprehensive study on its issues, identifying the key factors that affect its algorithmic performance. Furthermore, two metrics are proposed to generalize the concept of preservation which quantifies the similarities between the genotype and phenotype search space. The two classical translation codes i.e. binary and gray are studied based on the identified factors and a preservation analysis revealed the differences between them},

To use the proposed method(s), the choice of the representation should be considered first. In EC, often binary representation and real-valued representation are used. We propose a hybrid representation, composed of binary and real-valued representations for multi-objective optimisation problems. Several issues such as discretisation error in the binary representation, self-adaptation of strategy parameters and adaptive switching of representations are addressed. Experiments are conducted on five test functions using six different performance indices, which shows that the hybrid representation exhibits better and more stable performance than the single binary or real-valued representation.},
